# texCheckmate
Shell and Make utilities to inspect a LaTeX manuscript. 

Most are taken from Jonathan Dingel's logbook `Makefile`: [https://github.com/jdingel/projecttemplate/blob/master/paper/reviewing/Makefile](https://github.com/jdingel/projecttemplate/blob/master/paper/reviewing/Makefile).

## Assumptions
* The manuscript is `./main.tex` (if not, the scripts need to be changed).

## Use with `Make`
Comes with a `Makefile`, with quick CLI access to the utilities, some of which call scripts from [https://github.com/LSYS/texCheckmate/tree/main/inspecting](https://github.com/LSYS/texCheckmate/tree/main/inspecting).
